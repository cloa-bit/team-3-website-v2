    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = .5)) +

```

Something imporant to keep in mind is that **only 18.6% of the population of Minneapolis is black** ^["U.S. Census website". United States Census Bureau. October 5, 2010.]. Let's break it down by nieghborhood.


```{r echo=FALSE}
police %>%
  group_by(Neighborhood) %>%
  summarize(n=n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  slice(1:10) %>%
  ggplot() +
    geom_col(aes(x = reorder(Neighborhood, -n), y = n)) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = .5)) +
    labs(x = "Neighborhood", y = "Incidents")

```



```{r echo=FALSE}
police %>%
  group_by(Problem) %>%
  summarize(n=n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  slice(1:5) %>%
  ggplot() +
    geom_col(aes(x = reorder(Problem, -n), y = n)) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = .5)) +
    labs(x = "Problem", y = "Incidents")
```



```{r echo=FALSE}
police %>%
  filter(Neighborhood == "Downtown West") %>%
  group_by(Problem) %>%
  summarize(n=n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  slice(1:5) %>%
  ggplot() +
    geom_col(aes(x = reorder(Problem, -n), y = n)) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = .5)) +
    labs(title = "Downtown West", x = "Problem", y = "Incidents")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
police %>%
  filter(Neighborhood == "Downtown West") %>%
  group_by(Race) %>%
  summarize(n=n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  slice(1:5) %>%
  ggplot() +
    geom_col(aes(x = reorder(Race, -n), y = n)) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = .5)) +
    labs(title = "Downtown West", x = "Race", y = "Incidents")

```

Again we see the same trend in Downtown West as we see in all of Minneapolis.


```{r echo=FALSE}
police %>%
  filter(Neighborhood == "Downtown West", Race %in% c("Black", "White")) %>%
  ggplot() +
    geom_bar(aes(x = Race, color = ForceType, fill = ForceType)) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = .5)) +
    labs(title = "Downtown West", x = "Race", y = "Incidents", color = "Force Type", fill = "Force Type")
```


```{r echo=FALSE}
police %>%
  filter(Neighborhood == "Downtown West", Race %in% c("Black", "White")) %>%
  ggplot() +
    geom_bar(aes(x = Race, color = Is911Call, fill = Is911Call)) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = .5)) +
    labs(title = "Downtown West", x = "Race", y = "Incidents", color = "911 Call", fill = "911 Call")
```



```{r echo=FALSE}
police %>%
  filter(Neighborhood == "Downtown West", Race %in% c("Black", "White")) %>%
  ggplot() +
    geom_bar(aes(x = Race, color = SubjectInjury, fill = SubjectInjury)) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = .5)) +
    labs(title = "Downtown West", x = "Race", y = "Incidents", color = "Subject Injury", fill = "Subject Injury")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
police %>%
  filter(Neighborhood == "Downtown West", Race %in% c("Black", "White"), ForceType == "Chemical Irritant") %>%
  ggplot() +
    geom_bar(aes(x = Race, color = ForceTypeAction, fill = ForceTypeAction)) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = .5)) +
    labs(x = "Race", y = "Incidents", color = "Force Type Action", fill = "Force Type Action")
```




## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
